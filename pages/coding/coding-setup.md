## Terminal

If you're on a Mac, you'll want [iTerm2].

### Aliases

Are there some really long terminal commands that you find yourself typing out over and over again? Save yourself some typing with [Terminal aliases].

---

## Text editor

[Sublime Text 3] is what you need.

---

## Version control

Don't have version control already? Install [Git].

### Repositories

* [Github] is the most popular service, and offers unlimited public repositories for free. You can even host static sites on Github (including with custom domains). This blog is hosted on Github!

* [Bitbucket] is another good repository service, which gives you five private repositories with a free account. So if you're new to web development, use this for the projects which you don't want to be publicly visible.

## Browsers

I use [Chrome] as my main development browser and [Firefox] for testing. (It's generally a good idea to develop and test on different browsers so you can catch issues to which your development browser happens to have unilaterally decided to provide a solution.)
