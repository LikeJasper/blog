So you want to build a web application?

## Step 1: Generate an idea

## Step 2: Validate the idea

There's no way to tell if people will actually use whatever it is you've thought of without talking to them. As a rule of thumb, concrete questions about past actions are good indicators of an idea's value, and vague questions about future/hypothetical intentions are poor indicators.

For example, the best questions have answers like "I looked for an app to solve this problem, and I bought one but it didn't actually do what I needed" or "I've never looked for solutions to this problem". Bad questions have answers like "Yeah that's a great idea" or "I would definitely buy that if it was available".

## Step 3: Build an MVP

1. Make sure you're comfortable with your [coding basics].
2. Make sure you're happy with your [coding setup].
3. Set up a project.
4. Define your [behavioural tests].
5. Write your [unit tests].
6. Write code to pass the tests.
7. Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6.

## Step 4: Get feedback
