I'm a web developer living in Berlin, previously from London. The main purpose of this blog is to keep an updated record of the steps involved in creating a web application, covering the processâ€”

* from inception to production and beyond,
* from the most abstract overview of the process to incredibly specific suggestions (e.g. what to type in the command line),
* from the perspective of someone interested in every aspect of building a web application (no matter how far things get from programming),
* from the perspective of someone aiming to do everything the right way from the outset.

## Get started

[Start here] with web development steps at the most abstract level. You can navigate to more specific steps from there.
