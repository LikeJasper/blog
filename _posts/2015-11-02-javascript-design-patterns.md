I'm going through the excellent _Learning JavaScript Design Patterns_ by [Addy Osmani] right now.

What are design patterns? It's a concept that originated in architecture, emphasising the value of reusable solutions that can be applied to commonly occurring problems in design. In software design they're vetted by experienced programmers before being approved. In other words: learn design patterns if you want to code like a pro.

I'm typing out code as I go through the examples, mostly as a learning aid but also with the aim of having a stash of copy-paste-and-customise snippets ready at hand, although I'm not sure yet how useful that will be in practice. You can see what I've got so far at [this Github repository]. Note: all the code and comment content comes from _Learning JavaScript Design Patterns_ with only minor adaptations, I'm just dividing it into different files for convenience and only putting in the really essential information in as comments.

You can buy Osmani's physical book (or an ebook) from [O'Reilly Media], but there's also a [free version of the whole thing online].
