[GitHub] has created an online course for developers to learn Git and GitHub. For a limited time only there is [free access to their on-demand eLearning program on Wheelhouse][course link].

Even if you've used Git before I recommend taking a look if you want to get solid on all the commands you will regularly want to use. For example, I didn't know about Git aliases! Up until now I've been defining my own bash aliases, but now I know I can do things like `git cm "Commit message"` instead of `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
